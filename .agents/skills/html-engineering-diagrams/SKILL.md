# HTML Engineering Diagrams

## Quick start

1. Define what every node, line, arrow, color, and animation means.
2. Give the diagram one positioned stage and one shared coordinate system.
3. Render nodes first; render connectors as a separate layer behind them.
4. Derive connector endpoints from node edges or centers. Never stop at “looks close.”
5. Apply one visual system across diagrams: spacing, type, stroke, glow, status colors, and motion.
6. Inspect every diagram at full desktop scale and measure endpoint error in the browser.

Use semantic containers with an accessible label:

```html
<div class="diagram" aria-label="Request sequence from client to worker">
  <div class="node client">Client</div>
  <div class="node worker">Worker</div>
  <div class="connector request"><span>enqueue()</span></div>
</div>
```

## Build workflow

### 1. Model before styling

- List nodes, relationships, direction, states, and important values.
- Choose the diagram family before choosing layout: flow, sequence, hierarchy, state, topology, relationship, timeline, or metric.
- Remove any line that cannot be explained in one sentence.

### 2. Establish geometry

- Make the stage `position: relative`; position all nodes and connectors against it.
- Keep nodes and connectors inside the same padded inner rectangle.
- Use CSS Grid or Flexbox to establish repeated node centers.
- Share dimensions through custom properties instead of repeating magic numbers.
- For diagonal edges, calculate length with `hypot(dx, dy)` and angle with `atan2(dy, dx)`; rotate from `transform-origin: 0 50%`.

### 3. Draw connectors

- Start and end horizontal lines at node side edges.
- Start and end vertical lines at node top or bottom edges.
- Attach diagonal lines to explicit anchor points, normally edge centers.
- Put arrowheads at the destination and labels near the middle without changing line geometry.
- Use solid lines for calls or ownership, dashed lines for returns or optional flow, and glow only for active signals.

### 4. Add visual language and motion

- Keep strokes quieter than nodes; emphasize only the active path.
- Use a small semantic palette consistently across every diagram.
- Animate direction, throughput, state, or progress—not decoration alone.
- Animate particles along the actual connector path and preserve a static line beneath them.
- Support `prefers-reduced-motion`.

### 5. Verify

- Inspect each diagram individually at a normal desktop viewport.
- Check every connector in both directions: source attachment and destination attachment.
- Measure `getBoundingClientRect()` values; target 0 px error for orthogonal lines and less than 0.5 px for rotated lines.
- Confirm arrowheads point toward the destination, labels do not interrupt strokes, and animation follows the same path.
- Check for clipping, unintended gaps, overlaps, horizontal overflow, and browser-console errors.
- Run build, lint, and relevant tests after visual verification.
